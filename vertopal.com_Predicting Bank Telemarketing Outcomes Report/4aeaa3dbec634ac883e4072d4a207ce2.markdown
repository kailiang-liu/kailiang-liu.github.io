**[A. Introduction - Bank Marketing]{.underline}**

**1. Background and Motivation:**

EU banks experienced a deposit surge from June 2017 to June 2021,
particularly post-COVID. The deposit increase was driven by increased
savings and reduced spending due to uncertainty about the economy\'s
future. (*Europe Bank Deposits After COVID-19*, n.d.).

Deposits After COVID-19*, n.d.)

Fig 2. Data-driven marketing maturity statistics (Marous, 2022)
illustrate that the banking sector needs to catch up in adopting
data-driven marketing.

Banks continue to utilise telemarketing for product and service
promotion, but this method is often inefficient, time-consuming, and
ineffective in acquiring new clients.

**2. Business Problem:**

Portuguese banks must adapt to new strategies and utilise machine
learning for predictive insights to enhance their ability to promote
term deposits and compete with the rest of EU banks.

A.  **Targeted Marketing:** Banks can improve conversion rates by
    targeting clients based on model predictions rather than a general
    approach.

B.  **Optimisation of resources:** Predictive predictions are crucial
    for optimising bank resources, particularly telemarketing personnel,
    to enhance cost efficiency and return on investment by focusing on
    likely subscribers.

C.  **Personalisation of Client Interactions:** Machine learning enables
    banks to identify client data patterns and adjust their
    interactions, enhancing their offerings\' appeal.

Thus, the bank\'s promotional activities must be enhanced to increase
efficiency and effectiveness by devising a machine-learning model to
identify clients\' responses to term deposit marketing campaigns.

**[B. Data Understanding and Preparation]{.underline}**

**1. Data Characteristics:**

The dataset contains 41,188 bank client records, including 20 input
attributes, with a target variable labeled \"y\" indicating term deposit
subscription with no missing values but 12 duplicate rows have been
identified. The dataset comprises both numeric and categorical
attributes.

![](vertopal_4aeaa3dbec634ac883e4072d4a207ce2/media/image4.png){width="1.752136920384952in"

height="1.9283147419072615in"}

**2. Data Exploration:**

![](vertopal_4aeaa3dbec634ac883e4072d4a207ce2/media/image7.png){width="6.194822834645669in"
height="1.9125524934383202in"}

![](vertopal_4aeaa3dbec634ac883e4072d4a207ce2/media/image8.png){width="1.640625546806649in"

height="1.2903499562554681in"}

The dataset is imbalanced, with most values being \"no\" in column
\'y\'. Clients are mostly in their 20s to 40s, whereas younger
individuals lack investment experience, and older ones are hesitant to
invest in risky investments.

![](vertopal_4aeaa3dbec634ac883e4072d4a207ce2/media/image10.png){width="3.0677088801399823in"

height="1.9721325459317585in"}

The histogram of the distribution of y by month indicates that the
telemarketing campaign should focus on April to August for optimal
marketing success, as Portuguese bonuses are typically paid in June,
aligning with the histogram of euribor3m vs y vs month. (Dzhambazova,
2023)

![](vertopal_4aeaa3dbec634ac883e4072d4a207ce2/media/image12.png){width="3.098611111111111in"
height="1.5569444444444445in"}

The histogram of the distribution of y by duration reveals that
telemarketing calls typically last 101-200 seconds, with calls lasting
201-300 seconds having the highest success in attracting clients,
aligning with the mean duration of 258 seconds, suggesting that
telemarketers should aim for 201-300 seconds.

![](vertopal_4aeaa3dbec634ac883e4072d4a207ce2/media/image13.png){width="2.8673611111111112in"
height="2.5229166666666667in"}

The correlation heatmap reveals duration as the most correlated feature
with target variable y, followed by nr.employed, suggesting increased
client confidence in a bank with more employees, and euribo3m,
indicating the importance of deposit interest.

**3. Preparation**:

**Delimiter:** To separate the semicolon character and split the values
in each row into separate columns.

**Drop duplicates:** To remove duplicate rows.

**LabelEncoder:** Categorical variables need to be converted into dummy
variables for machine learning models. Columns_to_encode include
\'job\',\'marital\', \'education\', \'default\', \'housing\', \'loan\',
\'contact\', \'month\', and \'day_of_week\'. Converting them into dummy
variables expands the number of columns to around 50. A label encoder
labels each category within each column, maintaining consistency.

**Train test split**: The dataset is split into a training and testing
set at 80%-20% ratios, using SMOTE oversampling and RandomUnderSampler
to balance the training set. The numerical features are standardised
using StandardScaler.

height="0.6354166666666666in"}

**[C. Model Design and Result Illustration]{.underline}**

**1. Model Design:**

Given that our target variable is binary (\"yes\" or \"no\"), we
implemented a classification approach using binary variables, including
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector
Machine, Multi-layer Perceptron, and Voting Classifier, to efficiently
identify new clients likely to invest in term deposits, optimising
resources, enhancing its promotion and competitiveness with EU banks.

**a) Logistic Regression (LR):**

> The algorithm is a widely used model suitable for the banking sector
> for binary classification problems, predicting client acceptance of
> term deposits and enhancing promotional strategies.

-   **Predictive Output:** LR provides a probability score between 0 and
    > 1 for each customer, showcasing their likelihood to subscribe.

**b) Decision Trees (DT):**

> The algorithm effectively classifies datasets by dividing them into
> subsets based on feature values, resulting in a tree that can be
> easily visualized and interpreted to show the relationships.

-   **Predictive Output:** Binary outputs based on subscription
    > likelihood and also offer probability scores to gauge the
    > prediction\'s certainty.

**c) Random Forest (RF):**

> Random Forest, a combination of multiple decision trees, effectively
> prevents overfitting and offers more accurate predictions than a
> single decision tree.

-   **Predictive Output:** Similar to DT, binary outputs are based on
    > subscription likelihood and also offer probability scores to gauge
    > the prediction\'s certainty.

**d)** **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**

> Due to their strength in high-dimensional spaces, SVMs are effective
> in binary classification of diverse, non-linear data like
> telemarketing. We hope they can identify hidden patterns by finding
> the hyperplane that separates the datasets.

-   **Predictive Output:** Determines the hyperplane that separates the
    > data and classifies clients based on this boundary.

**e) Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP):**

> MLP can discover non-linear patterns and complex relationships in the
> data, which is helpful for telemarketing data.

-   **Predictive Output:** A neural network\'s prediction on whether a
    > customer will subscribe or not based on the learned patterns in
    > the data.

**f) Voting Classifier:**

> Ensemble models, like voting classifiers, enhance bank predictions by
> combining multiple models\' strengths, reducing potential shortcomings
> and providing more reliable predictions.

-   **Predictive Output:** A collective decision based on the
    > predictions from the ensemble of models.

**2. Model Construction:**

All models were constructed using Google Colab, ensuring a seamless
environment for data processing and model building. Here are the
parameter settings for each:

-   **LR:** max_iter: 1000 (We had increased it to try to ensure
    convergence due to the large size of the dataset), random_state: 42
    (For consistent results across the runs)

-   **DT:** full tree and pruned tree max 5 at 42 default settings with
    Fig 40,40.

-   **RF:** n_estimators=100, max_features = \"sqrt\", random_state=42

-   **SVM:** kernel=\'rbf\', random_state=42

-   **MLP:** random_state=1, hidden_layer_sizes= (20,10), activation =
    \'relu\', max_iter=2000

-   **Voting Classifier:** Comprised of the above models with soft
    voting to ensure probabilities were considered.

**3. Model Evaluation and Interpretation:**

**a) LR:**

-   **Performance:** Achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set.

-   **Interpretation:** The logistic regression model\'s coefficients
    > reveal which features significantly influence predictions, such as
    > \"euribom3\", suggesting higher interest increases the likelihood
    > of accepting term deposits, suggesting banks should telemarket
    > more during high-interest periods.

-   **Model results:**

-   There seems to be more features with a negative influence on the
    target variable. This can be seen by more features having negative
    coefficients.

-   The intercept, which is the baseline prediction, is 0.1533061.

> height="1.2748797025371827in"}

-   **Statsmodel:** The statsmodels Logit model was initialised using
    > the default parameters.

    -   Pseudo R-squared: It measures the goodness of fit. Our result is
        an infinity value, which is one of the challenges which we had
        faced.

    -   Coefficients: The majority of the features have negative
        coefficients

    -   P\>\|z\|: Most variables have p-values less than 0.05,
        indicating statistical significance, while \'education\' and
        \'previous\' have p-values higher than 0.05, suggesting they may
        not be significant predictors.

**d)** **SVM:**

-   **Performance:** SVM has an accuracy of 85% but similarly struggles
    with true positives.

-   **Interpretation:** SVMs, while powerful, are less interpretable
    directly. However, their strength lies in working efficiently with
    higher-dimensional data, which means they can handle many features
    and interactions effectively. Their success might indicate complex
    relationships in the data, suggesting banks incorporate more nuanced
    strategies.![](vertopal_4aeaa3dbec634ac883e4072d4a207ce2/media/image27.png){width="2.526042213473316in"

> height="1.7790048118985127in"}

**e) MLP:**

-   **Performance:** MLP, with its deep architecture, achieved an
    accuracy of 87%.

-   **Interpretation:** The neural network has three layers: an input
    layer, a first hidden layer with 20 neurons, and a second hidden
    layer with 10 neurons. Banks can invest more to analyse more
    in-depth data to unearth these hidden patterns and refine their
    strategies.

**Overview**

Random forest, with the highest accuracy score, is the most effective
model for identifying potential clients to subscribe to term deposits.
It estimates key variables for classification, crucial for targeted
marketing, resource optimisation, and client interaction
personalisation. The model\'s accuracy on the test set is approximately
88.2%.

**[D. Discussion & Concluding Remark]{.underline}**

**1. Summary and Implications:**

**Overview:** Our research commenced with the challenge faced by
Portuguese banks where conventional marketing avenues are inefficient in
promoting term deposits, especially post-COVID-19. To address this, we
employed a suite of machine learning algorithms, from the fundamental
Logistic Regression to ensemble methodologies like the Voting
Classifier.

**Patterns and Discoveries:**

-   **Influential Variables:** The research uncovered a significant
    relationship between variables and the likelihood of a client
    subscribing to a term deposit. For instance, attributes like call
    duration, euribo3m interest rates, and number of employees in the
    bank held pronounced influence in our models.

-   **Model Variances:** Each model has its unique strengths and
    shortcomings. For instance, while Decision Trees provided a
    transparent, intuitive understanding of decisions, they required
    pruning to avoid overfitting. The Voting Classifier, conversely,
    consolidated strengths from various models. However, its accuracy
    was below Random Forest, where it also has the highest F1-score for
    identifying true positives.

**Implications and Deployment Suggestions:**

-   **Tailored Marketing:** Banks can design personalised campaigns by
    understanding call duration and training telemarketers for more
    extended conversations or using digital platforms for interactive
    engagement with potential clients.

-   **Resource Optimisation:** Our predictive models enable the bank to
    use machine learning algorithms to identify potential clients,
    prioritise leads, improve resource allocation, minimise wasted
    efforts, and increase objectives.

**2. Limitations and Concluding Remarks:**

**Limitations:**

-   **Data Imbalance:** The inherent imbalance in the dataset, with
    fewer subscribers, poses challenges. Although we employed techniques
    like SMOTE, synthetic data might not capture all nuances of the
    minority class.

-   **External Factors:** While our models account for several
    influencing variables, significant events like global economic
    downturns, pandemics, war, or geopolitical events are beyond the
    predictive scope of our current models.

-   **Scope of Data:** The data is specific to Portuguese banks and
    might not cater to global banking network, highlighting the need for
    region-specific datasets and models when expanding scope.

-   **Relevancy:** Data and patterns observed are bound by time, and
    economic, social, and technological landscapes changes over time.
    The data collected from 2008 to 2013 might be less relevant today.

**\
**

**Concluding Remarks and Further Steps:**

In the intricate dance of numbers, patterns, and predictions, what
stands out is the transformative capability of data. Our research,
grounded in rigorous analysis, paves the way for Portuguese banks to
rethink and reshape their marketing strategies.

Future endeavours could explore:

-   **Global Analysis:** The Machine Learning model is currently limited
    to Portugal\'s banks, but it could be applied globally for financial
    product telemarketing, considering cultural norms and country
    regulations, for example in Singapore the PDPA and Do-Not-Call
    registry, among others. (PDPC \| Do Not Call Registry and Your
    Business, n.d.)

-   **Feedback Loop Integration:** Integrating a feedback loop where
    models are retrained based on their prediction outcomes for a truly
    adaptive system could ensure continuous learning and adaptation can
    help ensure the banks stay relevant and updated.

The data-driven approach is not a one-time venture. It requires
consistent updating, re-evaluation, and fine-tuning to stay relevant.
