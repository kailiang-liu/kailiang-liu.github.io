# Predicting Bank Telemarketing Outcomes

## Introduction

In this project, our aim was to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of bank telemarketing campaigns. By leveraging machine learning, we sought to identify patterns in client behavior that predict their response to term deposit marketing campaigns. This work is especially relevant in the context of European banks experiencing a surge in deposits post-COVID, underscoring the need for more targeted and efficient marketing strategies.

## Data Understanding and Preparation

We utilized a dataset comprising 41,188 bank client records, including 20 input attributes and a target variable indicating term deposit subscription. Our analysis began with comprehensive data cleaning and preparation, including handling duplicates and converting categorical variables into dummy variables for machine learning models.

## Key Insights from Data Exploration

- The dataset is imbalanced with a higher proportion of clients not subscribing to term deposits.
- Telemarketing campaigns should focus on April to August, aligning with the period of bonus payments in Portugal.
- Call durations of 201-300 seconds are most effective in attracting clients.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For handling the dataset.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model implementation.
