PROJECTS P
Machine Learning Project - Predicting Participation in Bank Marketing Campaigns M Aug 2023 - Oct 2023
Utilizing Python machine learning packages to predict the participation level in a new telemarketing campaign of a bank in
Portugal. The target variable was whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): E Conducted data cleaning through EDA, understood data features, assessed the
distribution of independent variables, and explored the relationship between independent variables and the target
variable.
Data Preprocessing: D Standardized continuous data, split the data into training and testing sets, and balanced the training
dataset through oversampling/undersampling methods.
Model Design: M Developed five classification algorithm models including Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, etc.,
and adjusted parameters accordingly.
Model Testing: M Trained the five models and incorporated them into a Voting Classifier for ensemble learning. Compared
the highest accuracy between Random Forest and Voting Classifier, ultimately deciding to use Random Forest as the
machine learning algorithm model to predict participation in the bank's marketing campaign.

ETL: E Utilized SSIS to extract data from the raw data source and successfully transformed it into a format consisting of
one fact table and several dimension tables (Star Schema).
Descriptive Analysis: D Employed PowerBI for data visualization, analyzing user churn reasons from various dimensions
and verifying hypotheses proposed by the customers.
